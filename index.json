Especially, since at the start we just got an email with not a lot of details. First me and my colleague (let\u0026rsquo;s say John), assumed that it was just some HTML \u0026amp; CSS templates. Something small, doable within a couple of days. In the end it turned out to be something completely different. Still fairly small, but I\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later.\nHow the requirements came to be A day later we go into the scheduled meeting, where the product owners (PO), along with two other developers explained to us the problem they were trying to solve. The client was a major US telecom, and they were trying to optimize their employee-to-store allocation.\nThey wanted to calculate which employees would be best allocated in which store(s). Matching things like:\n employee availability with store working hours employee location of residence with store location employee experience with store size  They had tried a bunch of possible solutions: Spreadsheets, MS Access etc., but the number of combinations of variables, required to produce the result-set they wanted was too large to run a couple of spreadsheet formulas across and calculate within a reasonable time. Even accounting for the fact that they would need to do this only once every few months. Luckily the development team there had experience with Python, which is quite useful for large amounts of data processing. They could write a set of custom scripts, which, when ran across the data, would yield the desired results.\nNow that\u0026rsquo;s all well and good, but running python scripts from the command line was not something you\u0026rsquo;d expect your average business manager be able to do. They needed some sort of graphical interface to comfortably manage everything. So after a couple of hours of back and forth with them, we came to a rough set of requirements. They needed to be able to do the following:\n Input the data, and calculation restrictions. See some indications that calculations are currently running. Have a look at the output data. Export the output data into an office-friendly CSV format.  We managed to secure a day for research from the guys, to see how we could best handle this.\nA plan of action Now that we worked out the functional requirements, we started looking for a way to make them a reality. The team consisted of just me and John. We are both web developers, and creating desktop applications was something we had limited experience in. Luckily I had some spare time before all this went down and had looked over a framework called Electron: A NodeJS/Chromium based tool for desktop application development, using web technologies. We spent a few hours looking over the documentation together, and came to the conclusion that it fully satisfied our functional needs. We could make this work.\nWe had another meeting next afternoon and let the guys know of our plan. It was time to kick off development.\nHow the plan was carried out The next day we looked over GitHub and found a popular Electron seed repository, featuring React as the component framework of choice. Things were off to a great start.\nWe plugged in React Bootstrap as our component library. This was more of a back-office, system tool, and not a client-facing one, there was no need for a fancy design. The UI had to be first and foremost functional. We synced this with our PO guys and they agreed wholeheartedly, as it would drastically reduce development and delivery time. As anyone, who\u0026rsquo;s worked on a custom design knows - Depending on the complexity it can take half, or even more of your development time working on the design alone. We themed the UI to use colors, consistent with our client\u0026rsquo;s brand and kept moving from there.\nOver the next week we worked closely with the Python team. Discussing the communication interface between the UI and calculation module. As development moved along, we noticed some extra quality of life improvements that could be made. For example - Since the employee distribution calculation took a substantial amount of time, we implemented a way to interrupt the process. This was useful in case someone made an error, inputting the data.\nOne by one, we implemented the functional requirements. Syncing daily with the PO and Python team. Demoing each feature, as implemented. We comfortably fit within the delivery timeline.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve scrubbed the UI for sensitive info, as well as made some adjustments so most things can fit on a single screen. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to share with you general overview of how things looked on the finished product.\n\r\rThe user interface\r\r\rFinally It was very exciting to work on a project with these implications, even if it was a bit short. It feels great, knowing you had a part in something that affects thousands of people. We got to expand our technology stack with Electron. A tool, quite handy for desktop application development and for people with our specific skill set. This allowed us to be able to take more varied projects in the future. And last, but not least, we had the chance to work with some lovely people abroad, on this thrilling project.\n","date":1563951994,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563951994,"objectID":"8ec4b5ad9faf551efe6e76f3574210d0","permalink":"/project/employee-assignment-optimization/","publishdate":"2019-07-24T10:06:34+03:00","relpermalink":"/project/employee-assignment-optimization/","section":"project","summary":"How our team played a role in making things nicer for thousands of people.","tags":["Desktop Application Development","UI Development","Electron","Node.js"],"title":"Employee Assignment Optimization","type":"project"},{"authors":["Momchil Anachkov"],"categories":[],"content":" Intro A client came to the company, where I was working at the time, and had a unique request. They had already successfully built a CFD trading website/platform and were looking for a few things we could provide. It was a great opportunity, both for the company, as well as our team, to grow and evolve.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s what they needed from us, the story of how each of these things came to be, the challenges we faced, how we overcame them, and in the end delivered a nice client experience.\nSupporting the already established code-base. The guys had already released the platform, but as with any software product, shipping is only half the battle. Once you get that large flow of users, you need a dedicated team to iron out issues, impossible to catch on a smaller testing scale. We were tasked with handling defect resolution, and in the meantime aligning the code-base with established best practices.\nTaking over a software project from another team is always a challenge as you need to step into the thoughts of the developers, when they were writing the code-base. This is also especially true when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a large-scale project, such as a trading platform. Luckily we had solid experience with the technology stack used: Node.js, NPM, Grunt along with Angular.js. So after a couple of introductory weeks filled with onboarding about functional requirements, and another couple for getting acquainted with the project architecture, we were confident enough to start making refactoring, and stabilization changes, without too much worry about regressions. We were off to a great start.\nDeveloping an iOS and Android app In this day and age everyone\u0026rsquo;s time is quite valuable. People have so many things to keep track and take care of throughout the day. Many users want the ability to carry out tasks on the go. This is the main reason many website development strategies embrace the mobile-first approach. Because stats show that most website traffic comes from mobile devices: tablets, phones and the like. This is exactly why our clients accurately deduced that they need a moblie version of their platform. And for a product that expects frequent use from single users, a dedicated iOS \u0026amp; Android app makes perfect sense.\nSo we took some time to research potential options. Let\u0026rsquo;s go over them.\nDeveloping a native App for each platform. One in Swift (for iOS), one in Java (for Android) Obviously the baseline approach was to write two applications. One for iDevice and one for Android users. This had some hefty implications.\n Twice the codebase. Every feature set would have to be implemented twice, tested twice, and maintained twice. While for a larger company this could be a potential option, due to the performance benefits of this approach, this large workload was something that would hevily affect tangible progress and the speed at which we could deliver. Platform-specific team capability. While we were well-versed in web development including many of it\u0026rsquo;s flavors, mobile app development was hardly our forte. We would have to dedicate extra time for knowledge acquisition, and learn on the go. While this is technically possible it would definitely affect deadlines and time-to-resolution in case of issues arising.  All in all, this route had some major drawbacks so we decided to keep looking for alternatives in hope of finding something better suited.\nTurning the mobile version of the platform into a Progressive Web App Next we considered going the Progressive Web App route. However at the time of analysis PWAs were still a novel concept and quite immature. API support for things like geolocation, and the like was still not stable. Add the fact that Apple and Google were not on the same page, regarding feature set, and one could see why we dismissed what lay down that road.\nSo we keep looking\u0026hellip;\nDeveloping a hybrid app And in comes the saving grace. While at the time, there were, and still are some issues with things like Cordova, Ionic and the like, it was the best fit for our case. The mobile version of the trading platform was already written and stable (👏). This meant that we could for the most part wrap the existing platform and go from there. There were many benefits to this.\n This required minimal effort. Relative to the native approach, the time that would be required to do this was minuscule. That meant that once we managed to package the web platform in a Cordova application we would have a stable base to move forward from. We inherit all of the app\u0026rsquo;s design. Existing users wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to learn a different UI to do the things they already knew how to do in their mobile workflow. Less code to maintain. Since Cordova apps are in essence web pages, presented in a native web view, we could reuse the codebase throughout all the platforms. That means that there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to be seperate people maintaining the app for an Android and iOS device, and even more than that\u0026hellip; Changes to the code would be reflected across all platforms. Since we\u0026rsquo;re using the same code base, once we develop a new feature, or fix an existing issue, that change could be pushed everywhere. Users of one platform wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for updates, already available on another one. This was quite important as we already knew there was a design overhaul looming in the near future.  We were extremely happy to have found a development strategy and stack that was so promising for our use-case. 🥳 This was not to say that the implementation was simple. As anyone familiar with Cordova, knows there are rules you have to obey, as there are with any framework. There is a very specific project structure, that you have to follow, and that meant we had to rework parts of the existing workflow so that all modules of the project can integrate successfuly and play nice with each other. Still, after a few days of overview, analysis, and planning how the integration would play out, we started restructuring things. After about a month of work, module by module, we successfully integrated the platform into a working hybrid mobile application. 🚀\nWe were now ready to start working on feature requests!\nRedesigning the mobile app and website While the platform was fully functional, along with the newly packaged mobile app, some time had passed, since release. As such, the design had become a little outdated. And so they came to us with a request:\n We have a new design in the works and we would like you guys to work with us on it\u0026rsquo;s implementation.\n Fantastic!\nFor about the next month we worked closely with our client\u0026rsquo;s designer to work out the details. As with any initial design, there were a few edge cases to iron out due to the dynamic nature of the app. I\u0026rsquo;m delighted to say that the redesign was quite successful and went very smoothly. I\u0026rsquo;m also happy to share the end result of some of that work with you. Take a look below.\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r  And due to our choice to go with a hybrid app approach we could easily update all the platforms we were targeting: Android, iOS and Mobile.\nAdding Themes Functionality Staring at a screen all day inevitably puts strain on your eyes. And while a white, bright theme may be ok on your phone if you want to check or do something on the go, it is definitely lacking, when it comes to working, surrounded by multiple displays throughout the day. And so the guys came to us with another request.\n We\u0026rsquo;d like our users to be able to customize the appearance of the platform to their needs.\n Now obviously brand-specific colors would have to remain the same, but there was no reason a sort of night mode couldn\u0026rsquo;t be implemented. So off we go! 🔥\n\u0026hellip; or so we thought.\nSadly the UI of the platform was not developed with theming in mind. I\u0026rsquo;m sure anyone who\u0026rsquo;s worked on custom themes, be they simple static color schemes, or allowing the user to customize each facet of the application, knows how important your markup \u0026amp; CSS structure is in such a case. And as you can imagine it took us a while to rework the UI, to become themable, moving forward with care not to cause any UI regressions.\nEven though it took some time, in the end all went well. We managed to rework the codebase to align it with the desired functionality, and plugged in the night mode color values and voila. A pleasant dark theme, that\u0026rsquo;s easy on the eyes.\n\r\r\rLight mode\r\r\r\r\rDark mode\r\r\rEven we, as a team were happy, since looking at the platform for a sizeable portion of the day, was much more pleasant.\nCopytrading An exciting time came along at one point, when our client came to us with their first functional feature request: Copytrading.\nSounds fancy. So what is that?\nThe idea is that certain investors can make their profiles public, allowing you to see their trading data i.e. what positions they have currently open, when they opened them, etc. You could then follow these traders, and what would happen is that you would start mirroring the positions they open and close from here on. The idea being, that if you have someone that consistently demonstrates profit over a longer period of time, you could follow them and trust that they know what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, as they probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to make bad investments themselves, and therefore net an easier, lower-risk profit.\nWe started development on it and after a couple of months of working together with the off-site backend team, to coordinate the API we managed to deliver what I would call a very successful implementation. You can view some of the related UI below.\n\r\rProfile details of a single trader\r\r\r\r\rList of traders\r\r\r In the end\u0026hellip; It was an interesting journey. It had it\u0026rsquo;s ups and downs, but there was definitely a lot to learn from it, and learn we did. Our team did a great job throughout: Analyzing the issues, picking the right tools and development approaches for the job, delivering competent solutions, aligned with the client\u0026rsquo;s needs, and ultimately fostering a healthy client-provider relationship.\n .phone-gallery { box-sizing: border-box; } .phone-gallery__content { overflow-x: scroll; white-space: nowrap; scrollbar-width: thin; } .phone-gallery figure:not(:last-of-type) { margin-right: 0.5rem; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px; } .phone-gallery figure { display: inline-block; border: 10px solid #010101; border-radius: 10px; margin-bottom: 1rem; } .phone-gallery figure img { height: 420px; } .copytrading-gallery { display: flex; } .copytrading-gallery figure { margin-top: 1rem !important; margin-right: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.35rem; }  ","date":1562198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562198400,"objectID":"8cec1fb69665749d5f4bd10587030d47","permalink":"/project/forex-trading-platform/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/forex-trading-platform/","section":"project","summary":"Web and Hybrid Mobile App Development and support.","tags":["Front-End Development","Hybrid Apps","Cordova","Integration","Theming","UI Development","Angular.js"],"title":"The story of a forex trading platform.","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"A showcase of the projects I've been involved in.","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"}]
