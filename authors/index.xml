      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is my passion. I like spending time researching different software archintectures, their strengths, weaknesses, and overall tradeoffs. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my teenage and adult life doing web development in one environment or another, be that high-school, college, commercial work, or passion/learning projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I specialize mainly in JavaScript web development, SQL, and Document databases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating quality software is difficult, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to share with you my thoughts on the process, as well as some things I&amp;rsquo;ve had a hand in.&lt;/p&gt;
